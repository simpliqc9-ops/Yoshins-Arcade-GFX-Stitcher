--------Rev 1.6--------
	Couple of substantial changes!
	For 1, games now each generate their own folders, so organixing things should be simpler.
	Interleaved PRG files now have the suffix .bin. Honestly, the intent was to make it simpler
	to overwrite in case like compiling with Easy68k
	Now the big one, introduced 2 vars to CPS1/2 Resource files, GFX_MAP and DE_INTERLEAVE_MODE
Taken from the new knights.py. Note, the addresses can be taken straight from Tile Molestor

GFX_MAP = {0 : ["OBJ", 0x0000000,0x0220000],
		   1 : ["SCR1",0x0220000,0x0260000],
		   2 : ["SCR2",0x0260000,0x0340000],
		   3 : ["SCR3",0x0340000,0x0400000],
		   }
DE_INTERLEAVE_MODE = 1 #1 for de-interleaving each GFX TYPE INSTEAD

	GFX_MAP allows you to map out the combined data into the 4 types of GFX, OBJ, SCR1/2/3. 
	These sections of data are manipulated in such a way that mimics how the CPS1 "sees" each kind of 
	GFX by seperating them into their own files DE_INTERLEAVE_MODE is a bit of a lazy hack if I'm honest, 
	by default the Stitcher takes the default GFX file that it spits out and de-interleaves it. This ensures 
	the update doesn't break any previous resource file, and simply adding
		DE_INTERLEAVE_MODE = 1
	Will set the Stitcher to interleave with the 4 output files instead
	!!!! WARNING !!!!
	Do NOT add said line if you haven't mapped out the Data in full.  You can reference Mames source (look into GFX_MAPs related
	to B-Boards) as well as personal deduction using the combined file. The reason for this is sections can oftentimes overlap,
	and what Capcom decided to do with these overlaps could vary (example, Knights' B-Board has about 0x020000 bytes of SCR1 go 
	into SCR2s map. Capcom used the overlapping bit for SCR2 tiles) 
	SCR1 sections can be spotted by noticing 2 8x8 tiles repeat.
	For instance, the font in Knights of the Round in the interleaved data looks like
		010123234545 etc
	SCR3 sections can be spotted by the GFX appearing deformed. This is cause there is additional interleaving involved
	As a starting point, I'd suggest referencing MAMEs source code as the B-Board of a given game as a starting point.
	CPS2 games were less restricted in this respect, so sadly you'll have to knuckle it out with them, but it can be done. You can
	find references to these GFX_MAPs in cps1_v.cpp
	Case in point, Knights of the Round

		{"knights",     CPS_B_21_BT4, mapper_KR63B,  0x36, 0, 0x34 },

	And if we look at the Mapper, mapper_KR63B

	#define mapper_KR63B    { 0x8000, 0x8000, 0, 0 }, mapper_KR63B_table
	static const struct gfx_range mapper_KR63B_table[] =
	{
		// verified from PAL dump:
		// bank0 = pin 19 (ROMs 1,3) & pin 18 (ROMs 2,4)
		// bank1 = pin 17 (ROMs 5,7) & pin 16 (ROMs 6,8)
		// pins 12,13,14,15 are always enabled

		/* type            start   end     bank */
		{ GFXTYPE_SPRITES, 0x0000, 0x7fff, 0 },
		{ GFXTYPE_SCROLL2, 0x0000, 0x7fff, 0 },

		{ GFXTYPE_SCROLL1, 0x8000, 0x9fff, 1 },
		{ GFXTYPE_SPRITES, 0x8000, 0xcfff, 1 },
		{ GFXTYPE_SCROLL2, 0x8000, 0xcfff, 1 },
		{ GFXTYPE_SCROLL3, 0xd000, 0xffff, 1 },
		{ 0 }

	If we add 1 to the end ranges and multiply the values by 0x40...
		/* type            start   end     bank */
		{ GFXTYPE_SPRITES, 0x000000, 0x200000, 0 },
		{ GFXTYPE_SCROLL2, 0x000000, 0x200000, 0 },

		{ GFXTYPE_SCROLL1, 0x200000, 0x280000, 1 },
		{ GFXTYPE_SPRITES, 0x200000, 0x340000, 1 },
		{ GFXTYPE_SCROLL2, 0x200000, 0x340000, 1 },
		{ GFXTYPE_SCROLL3, 0x340000, 0x400000, 1 },
		{ 0 }

		We get ranges very similar to our final result! We can now take these ranges, 
		view them in TM, and map out the GFX ourselves
		It's a touch tedious to do, but doing so gives you access to all the GFX in any game!


	NOTE: At some point Gowcaizr.py got corrupted. This should be fixed

	FULL FLEDGED CPS1 SUPPORT!!!
	The syntax for Resource files is a bit wonky, but the important thing is that
	the script should now be capable of working with any CPS1 Game! Forgotten Worlds
	in particular was really giving me grief, but now you can edit it to your hearts content!
	All previously supported games have been updated to use the new system, and a couple new
	ones have been added!
	All ya need to add CPS1 games is
		gfx_prefix = The name of each GFX ROM, easily found in Mames cps1.cpp
		rom_byte_size = How many Bytes each ROM reads in the group
		group_size = The number of ROMs in the group, used in conjunction with group_indexes
		group indexes = Data oftentimes "spills" in to the next group, so this is here to accomodate that happening when a ROM isn't
			read completely

######################### Improved PRG Interleaving! #########################
	The script has become more flexible by introducing import parameters. They work
	much and such the same as append, only they load the data to the start of the file
	as opposed to slapping it on the end. This allows games like Saturday Night Slam-Masters
	to have all it's program data properly read. Admittedly a bit slap dash but should get the job
	done. Let me know if any bugs spring up
	EXAMPLE:

	#Import this data first before we interleave anything
	prg_import = ["mbe_23e.8f",0x80000]
	import_swapendian = 2 #Swap the endian. 2 Indicates a length of 16-bits, so every 2 bytes

--------03/10/2022: Rev 1.21--------
	It seems i accidentally forgot to properly setup gowcaizr properly.
	The resuource file has been fixed and should thus work now


--------03/10/2022: Rev 1.2--------
######################### Program Data interleaving! #########################
	The script has branched out from just Graphics! It can now be used
	as a general purpose interleaver for Program data, thus making it
	useful for editing the actual code/data of older titles. The res file
	just needs to know a couple of things for this to work. We can have a
	look at what these are by using Asura Busters(asurabus) as an example
	
		#Intended system this res file is needed for
		System = "Fuukifg3"

		#Define all the names of Program data here
		prg_prefix = ["pgm3.u1", "pgm2.u2","pgm1.u3","pgm0.u4"]
		#Here we make an array to store every "group" of ROMs to interleave between
		#In this case, we interleave using all 4 files, so only 1 group is defined
		prg_groupsize = [4]
		#How many Bytes to interleave between groups
		#This results in the interleaved data taking a byte from the first file, then
		#the second, third and finally fourth. Back to the first, and so on and so on
		#until all the program data is read
		prg_grabsize = [1]
		#How big each group is
		#Define an individual ROM size here. Due to how interleaving works, ya can just
		#use the number of bytes of any of the program ROMs
		prg_romsize = [524288]
		
	You can also define whether to swap the Endian of the data as it's exported, thus letting
	ya edit the data as if the game itself was reading it! Make reverse engineering in Ghidra
	simpler as well. You can define it like this
	
		swapendian = 2 #Size of Endian, or how many Bytes to flip apiece
		#EXAMPLE: 2 is common, so a value of 0x4039 would be swapped to 0x3940
		#NOTE: Some games interleave the machine code but leave raw data alone. Comment out the Swapendian should you need to edit one or the other

	Nighty Warriors and Avengers in Galactic Storm make use of this
	You can also use the Stitcher to append PRG Data together, like in the case of garoup
	
		#Slap the rest of the data on there for ease of use
		prg_append =  ["proto_253-p1.p1", 0x100000, "proto_253-p2.p2", 0x400000]
		append_swapendian = 2
	
	The stitcher reads what file to append, how big it is, before incrementing by 2, functionally reading the next
	file in the table when the first one is done. The append_swapendian variable is there to flip the data so it
	ya can read it as it would be seen in the game itself
	It has also occured to me the stitcher can simply be used to swap the endian of 1 PRG ROM for ease of editing, 
	so hey that's cool!
	


######################### QOL: File Validation #########################
	Small thing to hopefully improve the user experience of the stitcher. When you define a game, the stitcher now
	checks your roms folder for the game. If it doesn't exist, make a folder for it. If a folder does exist, it checks
	if any GFX/PRG ROM to be read is present, as well as the interleaved data folder to check if the interleaved data exists.
	This should make it more clear if you can interleave/de-interleave data

CPS1 SUPPORT!
	After bashing against that wall for a while, the stitcher
	is now compatible with most CPS1 Games! There are fringe cases
	like Forgotten Worlds where the Stitcher isn't suitable, but by
	and large still usable with the majority of CPS1 games i've seen.
	The only real distinction between adding a CPS1 game as opposed to
	CPS2 is that there are a couple new vars to accomodate varying Group
	Sizes, and how many bytes to interleave per group
	For example, Final Fight is setup like this:
	
	gfx_prefix = ["ff-5m.7a", "ff-7m.9a", "ff-1m.3a", "ff-3m.5a"]

	group_size = [4]
	group_collec_size = [2]

	#Total size of each ROM group
	rsize0 = 2 << 18 #524288 bytes, or 512KB
	rsize1 = 2 << 19 #1048576 bytes, or 1MB
	rsize2 = 2 << 20 #2097152 bytes, or 2MB
	rsize3 = 2 << 21 #4194304 bytes, or 4MB
	rsize4 = 2 << 22 #8388608 bytes, or 8MB
	gfx_romsize = [rsize0]
	
	This will probably be adjusted at some point to accomodate games like
	Forgotten Worlds, but should still prove useful, i hope.
	To see the size of groups for ya game, make sure to check Mames cps1.cpp

NEO-GEO: PREFIX_OVERRIDE
	In order to accomodate Samurai Shodown 1, adjusted the code
	so now you can define a prefix_override array to read files of
	varying cx prefixes. In the case of Samsho 1, it's prefix_override
	looks like this

	prefix_override = [1,2,3,4,51,61]

	This indicates to the stitcher to read, in order,
	c1.c1
	c2.c2
	c3.c3
	c4.c4
	c51.c5
	c61.c6
